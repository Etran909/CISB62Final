    "# Food Reviews Sentiment Analysis & Recommendation System\n",
    "### By: Eric Tran\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "I will be attempting to improve upon the Amazon Fine Food Reviews SA and recommendation system given as an example in class, with different settings and methods. We will be using the 'Amazon Fine Food Review' from Kaggle at <br><br>https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews<br><br>\n",
    "Using the reviews, we will use a RNN with LSTM to perform Sentiment Analysis on the reviews. We will then use a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) using tensorflow v1 to make a recommendation system.\n",

    "The DL tools at our disposal is constantly growing more powerful and complex, but that does not necessarily mean more computational power in some cases as they can become more efficient as well. For comparison, the simple RNN with LSTM took over an hour to fit with only 8 epochs, while the RBM geared for efficiency did 24 epochs in under 10 minutes. They both had very low error, and were possibly overfit.\n",

    "If I were to do this over again, I would probably make the score of 3 positive rather than negative, or keep it neutral and used softmax with 3 dense neurons or tanh. Better yet, I should of tuned my hyperparameters with hparams or tensorboard rather than encoding in Kobe Bryant easter eggs. \n",
